# Automate-Job-Search
This is a python script to make it easier to create cover letters. The current process is a tedious copy-paste-rename procedure that is manual, hence being prone to human error. 

Current MVP:
- make a script that copies a file and renames it

Future Features:
- change the content of who the file is directed to.
